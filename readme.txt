== Description ==

Client Status is a dashboard that keeps tabs on your clients WordPress installations by checking for the latest updates to the WordPress core, plugins and themes. You have the option to enable emails to administrators of your site and the clients the site belongs to. Client Status can check for updates hourly, twice daily, or daily (uses the WordPress Cron system). This is meant to be a free alternative to the WordPress Status Dashboard found on codecanyon.net.
